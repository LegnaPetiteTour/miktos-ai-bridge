# Docker Security Guidelines

## Current Security Measures

### Multi-Stage Build

Our Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach:

1. **Builder Stage**: Uses `python:3.11-slim-bookworm` for installing dependencies
2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12` for minimal attack surface

### Security Benefits

- **Distroless Runtime**: The final image contains only the Python runtime and application code
- **No Package Manager**: No apt, pip, or shell in the final image
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential files are included
- **Regular Updates**: Base images are regularly updated for security patches

### Vulnerability Scanning

- **Trivy Scanner**: Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **SARIF Reports**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Automated Alerts**: Security issues are flagged in pull requests

### Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Non-root user execution (in development image)
- ✅ Multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
- ✅ Distroless runtime image
- ✅ .dockerignore to exclude sensitive files
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Minimal base images
- ✅ Regular security updates

## Addressing Current Vulnerabilities

The current high vulnerabilities detected are in the builder stage only and do not affect the runtime image. The distroless runtime image provides:

1. **No Shell Access**: Attackers cannot execute commands
2. **No Package Manager**: Cannot install additional packages
3. **Minimal Libraries**: Only Python runtime libraries included
4. **Regular Security Updates**: Google maintains security patches

## Production Recommendations

For production deployments:

1. Use the distroless image (default in our Dockerfile)
2. Enable vulnerability scanning in your container registry
3. Implement runtime security monitoring
4. Regular base image updates
5. Network policies to restrict container communication

## Monitoring and Updates

- **Weekly**: Dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Monthly**: Base image updates
- **Immediate**: Critical vulnerability patches

## Alternative Secure Images

If additional security is required, consider:

- `cgr.dev/chainguard/python:latest` (Chainguard Images)
- `scratch` with static Python binary
- Custom hardened images with minimal dependencies
